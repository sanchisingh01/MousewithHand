Virtual Hand-Controlled Mouse
üñêÔ∏è A Personalized Virtual Mouse Experience

Welcome to the Virtual Hand-Controlled Mouse project! This project is the result of my fascination with combining technology and interaction in a novel way. By utilizing Python, OpenCV, and the powerful Mediapipe library, I've crafted an innovative solution that allows you to control your computer using hand gestures captured through your webcam.

**Key Features**

Intuitive Interaction: Experience a new level of intuitive control as you navigate your computer using hand movements.

Real-time Tracking: The system employs advanced computer vision techniques to track specific landmarks on your hand, including your index and thumb fingers.

Gesture Recognition: Seamlessly perform actions like cursor positioning and clicking by utilizing recognized hand gestures.

**Getting Started:**

Follow these steps to get started with the Virtual Hand-Controlled Mouse project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the necessary libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the virtual_mouse.py script and experience the magic of controlling your computer with your hand!

**Contribution:** 

This project is open to contributions and improvements from the community. Whether you're a developer, designer, or simply curious, feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
